# Rubus

A Telegram bot intended for personal use by me and my friends.

## Goals

This project is mainly for me to have fun & learn new techniques while programming at home after work. However, the bot is also meant to be used in "production" in a private Telegram chat.

A secondary goal is to learn how to properly take advantage of Docker. I wish to have the bot running on my personal server as my previous bot is also running there. However, the previous one is running quite non-professionally directly in a screened terminal...

### Functionality

At least the following functionality are on the implementation list:

- [ ] Channel specific sticker sets
  - It's quite inconvenient to manually add and update sticker sets created by photos shared in the chat. Therefore, Rubus should be able to semi-automatically handle this.
- [ ] Daily weather reporting at scheduled times
  - Simply tell what the weather is going to be for the day.
  - Needs to support multiple locations.
- [ ] Query trending posts from Reddit
  - Post X amount of trending posts from a subreddit for discussion.
- [ ] Calendar with reminders for important events regarding the group
  - Periodic and/or one-shot reminders of important events
